### [wget-regex](https://github.com/warren-bank/wget-regex)

Fork of _wget 1.11.4_ that adds the ability to set regex filters to conditionally include or exclude files when downloading a website recursively

#### Background:

* I wrote this fork over a decade ago
  * at the time, patch files were sent to the project maintainer
  * he had no interest in adding new CLI options
* recently found the code
  * thought it would be fun to revisit the idea..

#### Toolchain:

* then:
  * MinGW
  * Msys
  * Bloodshed Dev-C++
* now:
  * [MinGW 16.1](https://nuwen.net/mingw.html)

#### Original Source Code:

* [wget 1.11.4](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/wget-1.11.4.tar.gz)

#### Libraries:

* [OpenSSL 1.0.2q](http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)
